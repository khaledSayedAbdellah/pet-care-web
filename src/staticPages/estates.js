                                <p className="card-text mt-4">According to article 902 of the Civil Code " All persons can dispose of and receive either by inter vivos gift or by will, except those declared by law incapable of doing so ". There is therefore no question of animals , which do not have legal personality. Therefore, they cannot receive: animals are not our heirs. Therefore, in the situation where the owner does not provide for any last will provision, the classic inheritance rules apply. The animal is thus part of the goods to be shared . It is nevertheless possible to escape this rule by indirectly excluding the pet from the mass of goods to be shared.</p>

                            <h3 className=" mt-5">The pet is part of the estate</h3>
                            <p className="card-text mt-4">When the deceased has nothing planned for their pet, the latter is included in the estate. The animal is part of the property to be shared and is subject to the rules of joint ownership ( when there are several heirs ). Thus, during the liquidation and sharing of joint ownership, it is not possible to favor the person who loves the animal of the deceased the most. In addition, difficulties may arise before the division of property; the animal may have entailed maintenance and food costs which will have to be reimbursed, but they must still have been carried out in the interest of joint ownership (Court of Appeal Paris, March 27, 2003) and whether there is consultation or prior authorization (Bordeaux Court of Appeal, 6 th Civil Chamber, March 4, 2014).

                            To avoid these rules, it should be pointed out that it is<strong> possible to reward your pet indirectly .</strong></p>

                            <p className="card-text my-4">Unless you are really demented, wanting to ensure the future of your animal is no longer considered by jurisprudence as a sign of dementia. This was still the case in 1964 (Court of Cassation, Civil Chamber, November 17, 1964).
                            Since the animal does not have legal personality, it is not a subject of law but an object of law. Therefore, the classic way to ensure your financial future is to go through a donation ( granting someone an advantage without any consideration ) with charges. However, conditions must be met: these charges must not be impossible, unlawful and immoral.

                            A trusted person (physical or moral), appointed by the settlor ( the deceased ), will receive the financial means to take care of the animal. It is a bequest with the charge of taking care of the animal. However, its effectiveness is questioned, in particular because of the lack of separate assets and the impossibility of involving a third party in order to ensure the smooth running of operations. Therefore, the trust is preferred instead. According to Professor Jean-Pierre Marguénaud, the trust overcomes the drawbacks of the legacy with responsibility for taking care of the animal since in particular the patrimonies are quite distinct. Indeed, the settlor (the owner of the animal) sees his property transferred to a trustee, which allows him to protect his patrimony from possible creditors of the trustee.

                            It is also possible to reward an animal protection association. You have to be very precise in order to avoid any interpretation problem. If there is a dispute, the classic rule applies, namely it is up to the applicant to prove what he is putting forward (eg: Court of Cassation, Civil Chamber, October 14, 2009).

                            Even if since the law n ° 2015-177 of February 16, 2015 introducing article 515-14 in the Civil Code, animals are no longer things but living beings endowed with sensitivity, they remain inheritance assets. Only the obtaining of legal personality for animals could regulate the fate of animals and by the same token the fear of certain people.</p>
